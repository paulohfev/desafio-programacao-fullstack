# Getting Started with the FullStack Solution Application

This project uses React.js + Redux Toolkit for the client (frontend) and Express.js for the server (backend).
The relational database used was MySQL, with sequelize used in the backend to make the connection.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, please run: `cd solution`.\
From here you should see two new directories: `transactions-server` and `transactions-client`. You will need to have both the client and the server running from your terminal to have the functionality on display.

Inside `transactions-client` you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the client app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Inside `transactions-server` you can run:

### `npm run dev`

This runs the server app in the development mode.
